        <p>Hello everyone, I am taking this class as part of my Applied Technologies degree. When I started programing I was not sure how I would do or if I would like it but have found that I enjoy it.  I have 3 kids. We have fun riding bikes and swimming, when the weather is warmer.</p>
        <p>Recently we went to the Washington DC Temple visitors center. There was a beautiful cresh (nativity) display. Each was donated by an embassy. It was a time we will cherish.</p>

        <p>The grounds were beautiful. It was about 6 degrees, so we stayed inside.</p>

        <p>This is the display from Austria.</p>
